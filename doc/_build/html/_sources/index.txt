Welcome to skope_rules' documentation!
============================================

This project can be useful to anyone who wishes to do supervised
classification under interpretability constraints: explicit logical
rules have to be used for classifying data.
This project is particularly suitable for supervised anomaly detection,
i.e. imbalanced classification.
Application domains include fraud detection, predictive
maintenance, intrusion detection, churn detection...

This project comes with a `skrules` module which contains a single
estimator with unit tests, along with examples and benchmarks.
