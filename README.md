skope-rules
===========

Skope-rules is a Python machine learning module built on top of
scikit-learn and distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

Skope-rules aims at learning logical, interpretable rules for "scoping" a target
class, i.e. detecting with high precision instances of this class.

Skope-rules is a trade off between the interpretability of a Decision Tree
and the modelization power of a Random Forest.

See the `AUTHORS.rst <AUTHORS.rst>`_ file for a list of contributors.

Installation
------------

You can get the latest sources with pip :

    pip install skope-rules

   
Quick Start
------------

SkopeRules can be used to describe classes with logical rules :

.. code:: python

    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from skrules import SkopeRules
    
    dataset = load_iris()
    feature_names = ['sepal_length', 'sepal_width', 'petal_length', 'petal_width']
    clf = SkopeRules(max_depth_duplication=2,
                     n_estimators=30,
                     precision_min=0.3,
                     recall_min=0.1,
                     feature_names=feature_names)
    
    for idx, species in enumerate(dataset.target_names):
        X, y = dataset.data, dataset.target
        clf.fit(X, y == idx)
        rules = clf.rules_[0:3]
        print("Rules for iris", species)
        for rule in rules:
            print(rule)
        print()
        print(20*'=')
        print()
::

SkopeRules can also be used as a predictor if you use the "score_top_rules" method :

.. code:: python

    from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
    from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    from skrules import SkopeRules
    
    dataset = load_boston()
    clf = SkopeRules(max_depth_duplication=None,
                     n_estimators=30,
                     precision_min=0.2,
                     recall_min=0.01,
                     feature_names=dataset.feature_names)
    
    X, y = dataset.data, dataset.target > 25
    X_train, y_train = X[:len(y)//2], y[:len(y)//2]
    X_test, y_test = X[len(y)//2:], y[len(y)//2:]
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_score = clf.score_top_rules(X_test) # Get a risk score for each test example
    precision, recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(y_test, y_score)
    plt.plot(recall, precision)
    plt.xlabel('Recall')
    plt.ylabel('Precision')
    plt.title('Precision Recall curve')
    plt.show()

Links with existing literature
-------------------------------

The main advantage of decision rules is that they are offering interpretable models. The problem of generating such rules has been widely considered in machine learning, see e.g. RuleFit [1], Slipper [2], LRI [3], MLRules[4].

A decision rule is a logical expression of the form "IF conditions THEN response". In a binary classification setting, if an instance satisfies conditions of the rule, then it is assigned to one of the two classes. If this instance does not satisfy conditions, it remains unassigned.

1) In [2, 3, 4], rules induction is done by considering each single decision rule as a base classifier in an ensemble, which is built by greedily minimizing some loss function.

2) In [1], rules are extracted from an ensemble of trees; a weighted combination of these rules is then built by solving a L1-regularized optimization problem over the weights as described in [5].

In this package, we use the second approach. Rules are extracted from tree ensemble, which allow us to take advantage of existing fast algorithms (such as bagged decision trees, or gradient boosting) to produce such tree ensemble. Too similar or duplicated rules are then removed, based on a similarity threshold of their supports.
The main goal of this package is to provide rules verifying precision and recall conditions. It still implements a score (`decision_function`) method, but which does not solve the L1-regularized optimization problem as in [1]. Instead, weights are simply proportional to the OOB associated precision of the rule.

This package also offers convenient methods to compute predictions with the k most precise rules (cf score_top_rules() and predict_top_rules() functions).
